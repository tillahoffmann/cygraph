Cygraph offers a high-performance drop-in replacement for unattributed, unweighted, undirected `networkx <https://github.com/networkx/networkx>`_ graphs. Using :code:`cygraph.Graph` instead of :code:`networkx.Graph` typically speeds up your code a little. Using :code:`cygraph`'s `cython <https://github.com/cython/cython>`_ interface enables order-of-magnitude performance improvements.
